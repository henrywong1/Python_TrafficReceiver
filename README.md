# Python_TrafficReceiver
Created Python Traffic Receiver to take in information, then obtain the following information: IP, Destination Port, and protocol.
This then compares to a set of values that were initialized, and returns success if the received network information matches your IP
destination port, and protocol. Else this would return failure.
